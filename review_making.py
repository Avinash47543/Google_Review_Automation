    3. Keep the review balanced and authentic
    4. Divide the reviews into two classes - Positives and Negatives
    5. Use simple language and avoid jargon.
    Length: 200-300 characters maximum for each review.
    6.Its okay to make grammatical mistakes in the review.
    7. Separate the reviews into two classes - Positives and Negatives
    
    Use these given example reviews as reference . Use them to understand the tone and style of the review:
    Positive:
    It's great that they offer amenities such as a gym, badminton court, and swimming pool, and when they are in use, they appear to be well maintained. I appreciate the overall environment and the fact that it feels like a good place to live. The layout of the 2 and 3 BHK flats is also something that people find appealing
    The infrastructure and landscaping create a beautiful atmosphere. The clubhouse, swimming pool, and fitness center cater to my needs. I appreciate the friendly community and proactive management, making it a safe place for families.I truly enjoy living in Jaipurias Sunrise Greens Premium.\
    Jubilee Hillview is a luxurious residential paradise with its breathtaking views and modern amenities. its just so beautiful. The club house for socializing it privides various activities for the members it's a perfect haven. The sports ground is a bonus for fitness enthusiasts. Good safety and security gives residence a peace of mind. The social maintenance is also very vibrant. A truly desirable place to live
    I enjoy the vibrant community and the good food options nearby. The ample parking space is also a significant plus for me. Society is located in an excellent locality, Koparkhairne sector 15, with main roads facing near Gulab Sons Dairy, IDBI bank, HDFC Bank, and the local market
    The location is fantastic, with easy access to schools, hospitals, and shopping areas. The community is well-maintained, and the staff is friendly and helpful. I love the spacious apartments and the beautiful landscaping. The amenities like the gym and swimming pool are a great bonus. Overall, it's a wonderful place to live.


    Negative:
    Accessing cars or even locating a nearby bus stop requires quite a walk, making it seem almost essential to have your own vehicle. Additionally, it's somewhat troubling to learn that the clubhouse and swimming pool have been closed for an extended period, along with the problem of recycled water in the toilets creating an unpleasant odor.
    I am disappointed with the ongoing issues like seepage and electricity problems. Despite the high maintenance charges, the management often falls short. While the location is great, I feel more effort is needed to resolve these concerns and enhance our living experience.
    Ongoing Construction near by soicety disrupts the peaceful environment at times. Additionally, improved safety measures around the community would enhance residents' peace of mind
    Despite it's stunning views, the amenities were poorly maintained. The clubhouse was often closed and the sports ground was neglected. Safety and security measures often lack, and social events were nonexistend. the luxurious feel was missing 
    The ageing condition of the building and the occasional rude behaviour from the security staff have taken away from what could have been a much better living experience. These issues make day-to-day life here less comfortable and negatively impact my overall living experience.
    Honestly, the experience was mostly positive. However, did encounter some security personnel who came across as arrogant, and overall, the staff and security weren't always good, which was a bit disappointing
    Not overly impressed. It's good, but it doesn't quite live up to the "heaven" description. It's a bit of an overstatement in my opinion.




Give Ratings according to reviews generated. The ratings Should match with the reviews generated.
   
Society Management Rating: Assign a rating (out of 5) for society management. 
Green Area Rating: Assign a rating (out of 5) for the green areas and parks. 
Amenities Rating: Assign a rating (out of 5) for the society's amenities. 
Connectivity Rating: Assign a rating (out of 5) for society connectivity and commute. 
Construction Rating: Assign a rating (out of 5) for society construction quality.
Use whole numbers for all ratings (1-5). 
If a specific rating cannot be determined from the reviews, use "NA"

Give one overall rating for the society by using the average of the above ratings in whole number between 1-5
